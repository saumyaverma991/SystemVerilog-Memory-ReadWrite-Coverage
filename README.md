# SystemVerilog Memory Read/Write Functional Coverage Testbench

This project demonstrates a functional coverage testbench in **SystemVerilog** for a simple **memory read/write design**. The goal is to test all combinations of write and read operations and collect **functional coverage** using SystemVerilog constructs.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The testbench is designed around the following components:

- **DUT (`memory`)** â€“ A simple register-based memory supporting read/write operations.
- **Interface (`interface.sv`)** â€“ Declares signals used between DUT and testbench.
- **Transaction (`tx.sv`)** â€“ Defines a class to encapsulate read/write operations.
- **Generator (`generator.sv`)** â€“ Creates transactions based on testcases.
- **BFM (`bfm.sv`)** â€“ Drives the DUT using transactions.
- **Monitor (`monitor.sv`)** â€“ Monitors DUT output and calculates coverage.
- **Coverage (`coverage.sv`)** â€“ Defines a covergroup to check write/read combinations.
- **Environment (`env.sv`)** â€“ Integrates generator, BFM, monitor, and coverage.
- **Top (`top.sv`)** â€“ Top-level module that connects everything and runs the simulation.
